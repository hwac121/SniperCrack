***Description***
This is a wifi handshake capture automation I am writing for educational purposes with a couple of really neat features. It requires apt and will look for and install, if needed, aircrack-ng, wash, mdk4, and crunch. It has a previous script I have written built into it to boost your wifi signal which will not work with the new naming system. Your OS must use the old naming system (i.e. wlan0, wlan1, etc.) I am still adding files and tweaking scripts and changing things around as I see fit so it is in no way complete nor ready for use.

Since it is being built for educational purposes I will be updating it live and adding files as I work on it. So as I work on it you will be able to see everything, every funny little note and comment I make along the way.

Take it apart, use bits of my code if you like, play with it, learn with it. All I ask is you give me a little tag line of credit if you use it or any part of it inside something you create. I am creating this out of automation, laziness, and for learning personally. As a Pentestor I can see this may even be useful to other pentestors, instructors, or those just starting out in the field of cyber security. Please enjoy and I hope others too use this as a learning experience.

Yes, it uses existing applications and serves as a utility to unite them all. All credit for aircrack-ng, wash, mdk4, and crunch belongs to their original authors only. I did not write nor assist in writing those scripts.
